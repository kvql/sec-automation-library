# Common Functions

This package is just a collection of handy functions which can be reused to save code repeating code in other functions

***NB: beware, changing functionality of these could cause unexpected consequeces.***

If you need to expand on it's probably best to create a new function rather than change the inputs or output of an existing function.


See the code for list of available functions and descriptions of what they do
